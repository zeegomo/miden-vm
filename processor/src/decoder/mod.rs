// DECODER
// ================================================================================================

/// Program decoder for the VM.
///
/// This component is responsible for decoding operations executed on the VM, computing the hash
/// of the executed program, as well as building an execution trace for these computations.
///
/// ## Execution trace
/// Decoder execution trace currently consists of 24 columns as illustrated below:
///
///  addr b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 h0 h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 h7 in_span g_count op_idx c0 c1 c2 be0 be1
/// ├────┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴──┴───────┴───────┴──────┴──┴──┴──┴───┴───┤
///
/// In the above, the meaning of the columns is as follows:
/// * addr column contains address of the hasher for the current block (row index from the
///   auxiliary hashing table). It also serves the role of unique block identifiers. This is
///   convenient, because hasher addresses are guaranteed to be unique.
/// * op_bits columns b0 through b6 are used to encode an operation to be executed by the VM.
///   Each of these columns contains a single binary value, which together form a single opcode.
/// * Hasher state columns h0 through h7. These are multi purpose columns used as follows:
///   - When starting decoding of a new code block (e.g., via JOIN, SPLIT, LOOP, SPAN operations)
///    these columns are used for providing inputs for the current block's hash computations.
///   - When finishing decoding of a code block (i.e., via END operation), these columns are
///     used to record the result of the hash computation.
///   - Inside a SPAN block, the first two columns are used to keep track of un-executed
///     operations in the current operation group, as well as the address of the parent code
///     block. The remaining 6 columns are unused by the decoder and, thus, can be used by the
///     VM as helper columns.
/// * in_span column is a binary flag set to ONE when we are inside a SPAN block, and to ZERO
///   otherwise.
/// * Operation group count column is used to keep track of the number of un-executed operation
///   groups in the current SPAN block.
/// * Operation index column is used to keep track of the indexes of the currently executing
///   operations within an operation group. Values in this column could be between 0 and 8
///   (both inclusive) as there could be at most 9 operations in an operation group.
/// * Operation batch flag columns c0, c1, c2 which indicate how many operation groups are in
///   a given operation batch. These flags are set only for SPAN or RESPAN operations, and are
///   set to ZEROs otherwise.
/// * Operation bit extra columns `be0` and `be1` which are used to reduce the degree of op flags
///   for operations.
///   - `be0` is set when op_bits[6] is ONE, op_bits[5] is ZERO, and op_bits[4] is ONE.
///   - `be1` is set when the two most significant op bits are ONE.
///
/// In addition to the execution trace, the decoder also contains the following:
/// - A set of hints used in construction of decoder-related columns in auxiliary trace segment.
/// - An instance of [DebugInfo] which is only populated in debug mode. This debug_info instance
///   includes operations executed by the VM and AsmOp decorators. AsmOp decorators are populated
///   only when both the processor and assembler are in debug mode.
